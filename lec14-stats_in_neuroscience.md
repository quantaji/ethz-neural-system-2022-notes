# A Estimation Theory
- extreme import in neuroscience, otherwise you go to nowhere
- you measure stuff from many neuron, transfer data to something else
    - how to take data and transform to others?

### MLE Estimator

## Question
- How do we usually denote an estimator of a parameter (relative to the parameter)?
    - hat ``\hat{X}``
- An estimator forms an estimate of a parameter, but it is a function of what?
    - data
- What is a ‘likelihood’?
    - likelihood of 
- What criterion can we use to define an estimator of a probabilistic model?
    - Max likelihood, MAP, Bayeisan estimation
- Why do maximum likelihood (ML) and maximum log likelihood produce the same estimator?
    - log unchanged under maximum
- What are the ML estimators for the mean and variance of Gaussian models of data?
    - mean, variance
